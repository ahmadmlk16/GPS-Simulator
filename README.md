# GPS-Simulator
/*
        Algorithm:
        1. This program stimulates a broken GPS by providing the x,y coordinates of your car as you cruise at 60 mph and go either North, South , East , West at an intersection that occurs every five minutes.
        2. Declare integers x and y.
        3. Use For loop to stimulate each intersection. a total of 12 intersections should occur.
        4. Generate a random number between 1 and 4 (inclusive).
        5. If number = 1 display car travelled east and add 5 miles to x.
           Else if number = 2 display car travelled west and subtract 5 miles to x.
           Else if number = 3 display car travelled north and add 5 miles to y.
           Else if number = 4 display car travelled South and subtract 5 miles to y.
        6. Calculate total distance travelled by car using distance formula and x,y coordinates.
        7. Display car distance.
